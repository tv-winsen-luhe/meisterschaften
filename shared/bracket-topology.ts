// Pure position arithmetic keyed on `(round, position, depth)`: it *walks* a bracket draw.ts has already
// *built* (draw.ts builds the tree, this walks it), so it holds no draw machinery and imports nothing back
// — a one-way dependency (draw.ts → this), no runtime cycle. Callers resolve the coordinates this returns
// against the match set they already hold, so main-vs-consolation falls out for free: a consolation bracket
// has no `(depth, 1)` match, so a loser edge there resolves to nothing (exactly today's `find(thirdPlace)`).

// A bracket coordinate — a match's `(round, position)` address. The two feeders below a match, a winner's
// target parent, the semifinals, and the third-place playoff all name one, so it is the shared return
// shape. An explicit interface, not an inline `{ round; position }` — the lint rule bans an inline object
// type in an annotation (TSTypeAnnotation > TSTypeLiteral), return types included.
